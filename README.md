🕵️‍♂️ BSGS (Baby-Step Giant-Step) Bitcoin Puzzle Solver - Manual

Welcome to the most over-engineered, thread-parallel, memory-optimized, and slightly obsessive Bitcoin puzzle solver! This tool will either:
1) Make you rich 🤑
2) Make your CPU cry 😭
3) Both (most likely)

📜 Official Disclaimer
"This tool won't actually solve Puzzle #69+ unless you have a quantum computer hidden in your basement. But hey, it's fun to pretend!"

🚀 Installation

1. Clone this repo (if you can find it in the sea of other puzzle solvers):
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/NoMachine1/BSGS
   cd bsgs-solver
  ```
3. Install dependencies (warning: may cause existential dread):
   ```
   sudo apt install libgmp-dev libomp-dev xxhash pigz
   ```
4. Compile with maximum optimization (because we're professionals here):
   ```
   g++ -O3 -fopenmp -march=native -o bsgs bsgs.cpp -lgmp -lxxhash
   ```
🎮 Usage

Basic command (for mere mortals):
 ```
./bsgs -p 30 -k 03abcdef...xyz
```
Pro mode (because you have a Threadripper and want to show off):
 ```
./bsgs -p 40 -k 03abcdef...xyz -t 32 -v
```
🧠 How It Works (The "Magic")
1. Baby Steps: Creates a huge lookup table (then compresses it because we're not animals)
2. Giant Steps: Jumps around the elliptic curve like a caffeinated kangaroo
3. Profit: Either finds your private key or turns your computer into a space heater

💾 Storage Requirements
| Puzzle # | Approx. Table Size | Chance of Success |

| 40       | 2GB              | 😅 Fine     |
| 50       | 20GB              | 😅 Good luck |
| 60+      | 200GB | 🤣 See you in 2050 |
| 70+      | More than all HDDs | 🚀 Quantum time!  |

⚠️ Known Issues
1. Your electricity bill might increase
2. Your significant other might leave you
3. Your cat might sit on your keyboard at a critical moment
4. The solution is always in the last range you check

🎉 Pro Tips
- Run this on your work computer (what are they gonna do, fire you for being ambitious?)
- Name your processes creatively (sudo renice -n -20 -p $(pgrep bsgs))
- If it's taking too long, just stare intensely at the screen - this helps

📜 Final Warning
This tool comes with absolutely no warranty, except the guarantee that it will make you obsessively check the output every 5 minutes. Happy hunting!

Made with ❤️, caffeine.
